It\n","\n","* accepts data or instructions as input,\n","* stores data and instructions\n","* processes data as per the instructions,\n","* controls all operations inside a computer, and\n","* gives results in the form of output.\n","\n","![computer_organization](https://mmit2k9.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/basic-computer-organization.jpg?w=496&h=276)\n","\n","*Dotted lines indicate\n","flow of instruction and solid lines\n","indicate flow of data*\n","\n","## Memory\n","Computer's memory can be classified into two types; *primary*\n","memory and *secondary* memory\n","1.  Primary Memory can be further classified as **RAM** and **ROM**\n","\n","  * RAM (Random Access Memory) is the place in a computer where\n","the operating system, application programs and the\n","data in current use are kept temporarily so that they\n","can be accessed by the computer's processor. It is\n","said to be \"volatile\" (unstable) since its contents are accessible\n","only as long as the computer is on. The contents of RAM are no more available once the computer is\n","turned off. There are 2 main types of RAM: **Dynamic RAM (DRAM)** and **Static RAM (SRAM)**. DRAM has to be refreshed every few milliseconds to retain data, unlike SRAM that keeps data in the memory as long as power is supplied to the system. SRAM is faster but more expensive, making DRAM more common in computer systems. \n","  * ROM (Read Only Memory) is a special type of memory\n","which can only be read and contents of which are not\n","lost even when the computer is switched off. ROM mainly contains manufacturer's instructions and also stores an initial program called the\n","\"bootstrap loader\" whose function is to start the operation of computer system once the power is turned on.\n","\n","2.  Secondary Memory\n","\n","Secondary memory is storage other than the RAM, including hard disks, CDs, DVDs,USBs etc.\n","\n","![Computer Memory](https://www.atpinc.com/upload/images/2018/11-08/7ad78cfc059443bab70a2d7848fd4d4a.jpg)\n","\n","## Functional Units\n","\n","1. **Input Unit**: This unit is used for entering data and programs into the computer system by the user for\n","processing.\n","2. **Storage Unit**: The storage unit is used for storing data\n","and instructions before and after processing. \n","3. **Output Unit**: The output unit is used for storing the\n","result as output produced by the computer after\n","processing.\n","4. **Processing**: The task of performing operations like\n","arithmetic and logical operations is called processing.\n","The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** takes data and\n","instructions from the storage unit and makes all sorts of\n","calculations based on the instructions given and the type\n","of data provided. It is then sent back to the storage unit.\n","CPU includes **Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)** and **Control Unit\n","(CU)**\n","* **Arithmetic Logic Unit**: All calculations and\n","comparisons, based on the instructions provided, are\n","carried out within the ALU. It performs arithmetic\n","functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication,\n","division and also logical operations like greater than,\n","less than and equal to etc.\n","* **Control Unit**: Controlling of all operations like input,\n","processing and output are performed by control unit.\n","It takes care of step by step processing of all operations\n","inside the computer.\n","\n","**Cache** is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewere. \n","\n","\n","A CPU works together with a **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** to give applications faster computing and processing power. A GPU enhances CPU architecture by accelerating portions of an application while the rest continues to run on the CPU. The CPU remains a reliable processor for general-purpose computing while a GPU accelerated graphics card steps in when intensive computations are needed.\n","\n","![CPU vs GPU](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nader_Ben_Amor/publication/297734079/figure/fig10/AS:669424134680581@1536614559506/CPU-vs-GPU-architecture.ppm)\n","\n","While GPUs are faster and more powerful than a CPU, they are not as versatile as CPUs. CPUs can perform many more kinds of tasks than a GPU because they have large and broad instruction sets. CPUs can also manage every input and output of a computer, which a GPU cannot do.\n","\n","A GPU has advanced calculation ability that accelerates the amount of data a CPU can process in a given amount of time. When there are specialized programs that require *complex mathematical calculations*, such as **deep learning** or **machine learning**, those calculations can be offloaded by the GPU. This frees up time and resources for the CPU to complete other tasks more efficiently.\n","\n","**Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)** announced in May 2016, is an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google for neural network machine learning. TPU is designed to perform more than 10 times more operations per cycle than GPU with less energy consumption. In comparison with CPUs and GPUs, TPU is domain-specific minimalistic processor.

Byte code can run much more quickly than the original code statements in the text file. Python will store the byte code of the program in files that end with a .pyc extension after running the program for the first time. Next time we run the program, Python will load the .pyc files and skip the compilation step, as long as the source code is not changed. \n","Python automatically checks the last-modified timestamps of source and byte code files to know whether it needs to be recompiled.\n","\n","#### Python Virtual Machine\n","\n","Once the program has been compiled to byte code (or loaded from existing .pyc files), it is transfered for execution to the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which is a big code loop that iterates through the byte code instructions to carry out their operations.

There are many ways to start the command line: in an IDE (Integrated development environment), from a system shell prompt etc.\n","\n","* On Windows, you can type **python** in the program named cmd.exe and usually known as **Command Prompt**.  \n","* On Mac OS X, you can start a Python interactive interpreter by double-clicking on Applications → Utilities → Terminal, and then typing **python** in the window that opens up. \n","* On Linux (and other Unixes), you might type this command in a shell or terminal window (for instance, in an xterm or console running a shell such as ksh or csh).\n","\n","To exit from the python session you can type **exit()** or just use the **Ctrl+Z**.\n","\n","The interactive prompt is a nice place *to experiment with the language* and to see what a piece of code does, since the code is executed immediately. It's also useful for *testing* already written codes in files. \n","\n","Although the interactive prompt is good for experimenting and testing, the programs we type go away after the code is executed, meaning that the code is not stored. This is especially a drawback when we are writing a large program. To avoid this problem, we can write programs in text files (with .py extension), as mentioned above, then pass it to the Python interpreter through the command line. These code files are also known as **modules** (or programs, scripts).
