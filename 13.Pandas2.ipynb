operations like negation and trigonometric functions, these ufuncs will *preserve index and column labels* in the output, and for binary operations such as addition and multiplication, Pandas will automatically *align indices* when passing the objects to the ufunc.\n","This means that keeping the context of data and combining data from different sources–both potentially error-prone tasks with

feature offered by Pandas is its high-performance, in-memory join and merge operations.\n","If you have ever worked with databases, you should be familiar with this type of data interaction.\n","The main interface for this is the ``pd.merge`` function, and we'll see few examples of how this can work in practice.\n","\n","## Relational Algebra\n","\n","The behavior implemented in ``pd.merge()`` is a subset of what is known as *relational algebra*, which is a formal set of rules for manipulating relational data, and forms the conceptual foundation of operations available in most databases.\n","The strength of the relational algebra approach is that it proposes several primitive operations, which become the building blocks of more complicated operations on any dataset.\n","With this lexicon of fundamental operations implemented efficiently in a database or other program, a wide range of fairly complicated composite operations can be performed.\n","\n","Pandas implements several of these fundamental building-blocks in the ``pd.merge()`` function and the related ``join()`` method of ``Series`` and ``Dataframe``s.\n","As we will see, these let you efficiently link data from different sources.\n","\n","## Categories of Joins\n","\n","The ``pd.merge()`` function implements a number of types of joins: the *one-to-one*, *many-to-one*, and *many-to-many* joins.\n","All three types of joins are accessed via an identical call to the ``pd.merge()`` interface; the type of join performed depends on the form of the input data.\n","Here we will show simple examples of the three types of merges, and discuss detailed options further below.\n","\n","### One-to-one joins\n","\n","Perhaps the simplest type of merge expresion is the one-to-one join, which is in many ways very similar to the column-wise concatenation seen above.\n","As a concrete example, consider the following two ``DataFrames`` which contain information on several employees in a company:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZFOg71eAH63B","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":221},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599830166616,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":1289,"user":{"displayName":"Nshan
